  Assignment 1 Report

To solve this problem which was taking information and then storing it into the program. Using a local file we gathered basic information about a representative from a particular district. This requires us to be able to read in the file to have said information, the idea was after we had this information we would print it out in the console for the user to see in order to know the data was actually stored. 
	We created a readFile method to read the local file to be able to store that information for the user about the particular district. The reader scans through each line in the file and assigns it a char value and stores it to be accessed later. Using a number of for and while loops we are able to successfully make this reader and scan the files to be printed in the console.
The comments in the code describe what specific lines are doing to effectively communicate with the user about what exactly is going on in the lines of code. Some comments indicate that there are loops within loops, this helps identify and label each loop so when you have to go back in and debug you are able to specifically identify which loop each is. This helps for finding errors in these loops if anything goes wrong so you do not get confused which bracket goes to which bracket. All of this was designed to be able to take in info about a district that was from a URL website that we used as a local text file.
